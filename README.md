## Description

This is a simple mod that modifies the enchanting table in two ways:

1.  The tool tip now always shows every enchantment instead of only one.
2.  Clicking on the book generates a new set of enchantments for the price of 6 lapis lazuli

## Notes

* The Fabric version also requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
* The Forge version is a port of the Fabric version. Even if it worked for me I don't have the most trust into it.
